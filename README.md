## 📁 File Overview

| File Extension | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `.PrjPcb`      | Main Altium Project File. Use this to manage and compile the entire design. |
| `.SchDoc`      | Schematic Diagram. Start your design here by placing components and defining connections. |
| `.SchLib`      | Schematic Library. Custom components used in the schematic design. |
| `.PcbLib`      | PCB Footprint Library. Used to define physical footprints for components. |
| `.PcbDoc`      | PCB Layout. Transferred from the schematic for routing and physical design. |

## 🔧 Getting Started with the Project

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
2. Open `Basic_Led.PrjPcb` in Altium Designer.
3. Start with `Basic_Led.SchDoc` to view or edit the circuit schematic.
4. Add or review custom libraries in `.SchLib` and `.PcbLib`.
5. Compile the project to generate the netlist.
6. Open `Basic_Led.PcbDoc` and import changes to start the PCB layout process.
